it should be possible to setup a github action for this when the monorepo is
gone and master commits are setup and PRs submitted.

For now:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build   --force-recreate  --renew-anon-volumes --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from=test

will run tests

If you leave off the last two options, there's a container that hangs around
that sleeps for a day that normally does not do anyting with:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml exec -ti dev /bin/bash

The local directory is mounted as /code and tests can be checked out there.
This is the same container as the test container, just without running any
tests.

/scratch is shared amongst all the containers and contains the output of
vault startup and also where all the various files are stored for the tests.
This should arguably not be shared.

The test container takes care of initializing approle
