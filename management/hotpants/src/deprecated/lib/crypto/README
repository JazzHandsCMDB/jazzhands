# $Id$

Everything under this directory was taken from the NetBSD sources.  The
functions here are used to check PINs, which are stored in the same hash
format as a standard UNIX password.  However, as crypt(3) and friends are
not thread-friendly, these functions have been modified to allocate storage
and have a '_r' appended to the function to denote this; it is therefore
up to the calling function to free it.

It will be necessary to fetch this from NetBSD's distribution as its not
included in the distribution   The file structure looks like this:
