/*
 * These routines support the management of account collections for people that
 * report to and rollup to a given person.
 *
 * They were written with multiple account_realms in mind, although the triggers
 * only support all this for the default realm as defined by properties, so
 * a multiple realm context is untested.
 *
 * Many of the routines accept optional arguments for various fields.  This is
 * to speed up calling functions so the same queries do not need to be run
 * multiple times.  There is probably room for additional cleverness around
 * all this.  If those values are not specified, then they get looked up.
 *
 * This handles both contractors and employees.  It should probably be
 * tweaked to just handle employees.
