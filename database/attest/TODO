 - numerous XXX's
 - approval vs approved case, consider syncing
 - recertify chain reject needs to go back to jira-hr
   this will create a loop, which is likely fine EXCEPT...
   	it should ALWAYS go to a new step, and not to an existing one.
	not sure if this should be inferred or approve should say "do it"

	This may not be practical because of the current implementation
	but if items are approved individually and not all are done, then
	it can attach something to a new step.

	the issue is when the approval_process_chain_id is the same, which
	it would be for a new jira-hr and a new recertify unless they are
	completed.  This should not happen with jira-hr, but could happen
	with a partial recertify.
