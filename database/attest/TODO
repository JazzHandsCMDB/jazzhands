 - numerous XXX's
 - approval vs approved case, consider syncing
 - recertify chain reject needs to go back to jira-hr
   this will create a loop, which is likely fine EXCEPT...
   	it should ALWAYS go to a new step, and not to an existing one.
	not sure if this should be inferred or approve should say "do it"

	This may not be practical because of the current implementation
	but if items are approved individually and not all are done, then
	it can attach something to a new step.

	the issue is when the approval_process_chain_id is the same, which
	it would be for a new jira-hr and a new recertify unless they are
	completed.  This should not happen with jira-hr, but could happen
	with a partial recertify.
- EXCEPTION error codes

- triggers

- remove all debugging RAISE NOTICE, even those that are commented out

- is it ok to approve without approve_account_id ?  If so, jira handler needs
  to handle the case of unassigned users.o
- UX changes:
	row Chris
		[correct |incorrect] Chris -> move it to the right!

		dealing with how people read

	default everything to correcct?

	one button per person.  if I click
		incorrect, then get into details of what is/is not correct
		if correct, leave blank, if not 

	more prominent submit button (green button) [ once per page ]

	leading page?

	maybe sliding  thing for the future to force reading?

	
		secondary button grey
- reports

email itself: why its important
	should only take five minutes (really easy)
	explicit  due date!

	placeholder text in correction box
		start with full drop down, type and it fixes it

		grouping things (parentage?)

	overdue on single sign on?
