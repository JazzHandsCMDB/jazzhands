approval and attestation are two sides of the same coin
 - what do you do if something expires, particularly attestation
 - how often does the attestation need to happen (annual,quarter,month,week)
conceptual 

approval_process
 - thing to approve
	property collections most likely
	other db fields, optional
 - pointer to a chain
 - how do we deal with pending, particularly for <whatever> additions?
	account_collection_account?

approval_chain
 - conceptual who (possible concept of overrides)
 - how long do they have to do it?
 - how to escalate when they don't.
 - next step -- accept/reject separately?
 	- who next (pointer to another chain?)

approval instance
 - start
 - end
 - id of first step
- possible attestation properties

approval step
  - approval_instance_id
  - id of the chain
  - start, end dates
  - who actually did this step
  - ptr to next step

approved item
 - property link, or maybe just a copy of properties
 - potentially refer to an audit log record instead of a live record
 - the result (approve/disaprove)
 - whether or not its considered done

approval step and approved item will have a m-m table that associates each
step with each item.

approval step will basically be everything that is attested to/approved for
a given item

===

the rollup from item to step should be done by trigger, and jira tickets only
opened when the entire set is done (to minimize the number of jira tickets).

triggers should complete prevented attestations from being added to once they
are marked as completed (new and update rows in approval_instance_step_item)

label, lhs, rhs

instance and step get rolled into one, in which case we lose the ability
	to have an entity that is "all this stuff a given manager must
	approve" (it can be inferred)

step can get an iteration number

instance - per group of things that needs to be approved (currently manager)
 step -  per manager/approver
 item - per thing attested


changes:
instance needs to become "once per quarter"
cluster thing on attestation page by steps
approval_instance_step_item m-m goes away step goes into item.
