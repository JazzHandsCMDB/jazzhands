notes from 2015-12-10 --

Goals:
1) acls
2) puppet variables et al
3) config files
4) gslb/lb/etc

other stuff I did not write down

 - we do not track internal-to-endpoint items ("subsystems" version?)
   think about an api endpoint that devices that farms out to other
   devices
 - need a way to represent open to all (internet?  internal?  etc?)
 - make sure we can represent owners/approvers/other roles
 - how to if the end point is working? (feeds into gslb etc)
   capture request string/search string stuff?
 - how do we deal with things coming in or going out that meet slas?
 - an endpoint may provide multiple services?
 - how to handle two services colocated on the same endpoint host?
 - hoe to translate scope to availability
 - "show me all the things that could be part of this" vs endpoints
 - endpoints for services vs 33 different DNS endpoints
 - capacity of a group particualrly shared endpoints
