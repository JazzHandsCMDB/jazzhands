-- This query pulls out all the device collection overrides
--
-- NOTE:  This view does not attempt to validate if a user has any
-- association with a device collection, just if a user is there, what
-- properties are set.  Its primary use is by other views.
--
-- It includes entries for all mclasses and will also include contrived entries
-- for every -- per-device device collection by mapping it through devices 
-- to an mclass.
-- That is, if there is a ForceHome (or whatever) on an mclass and that user is
-- added to the per-device collection, the ForceHome will show up on the
-- per-device collection too.  This is used to do the device mappings for
-- ownership and the like
