-- was originally in netblock/index.pl from stab.  It originally had
-- 	connect by prior nb.netblock_id = parent_netblock_id
-- 	start with nb.parent_netblock_id = ?
-- 	order siblings by ip_address, netmask_bits
-- and this makes the root selection by including root_netblock_id.
-- This may break down the "everything can be represented by a view" because
-- the recursive table takes too long to build.

-- the postgresql query would have the restriction in the non recursive part
-- of the with query
