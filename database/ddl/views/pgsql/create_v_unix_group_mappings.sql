-- This query returns what can become a group entry for a given mclass,
-- applying all the various ways for mclass properties to tweak behavior
--
-- This relies on v_device_col_account_col_cart which limits the responses to
-- just mclasses/accounts mapped through the UnixGroup property.  That feature
-- may be able to be undone...
