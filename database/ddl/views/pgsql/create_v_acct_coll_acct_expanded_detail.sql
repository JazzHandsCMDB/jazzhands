-- NOTE: direct_account_collection_parent_id is a better name for
-- root_account_collection_id
--
-- account_collection_id ends up being the one that is the ultimate parent
-- and what someone just looking at the view may think of the root ("all the
-- accounts that are part of this account collection")
--
-- the nomenclature probably comes from oracle's connect by root
