-- This query maps device collections to accounts and limits it accounts
-- that are associated with a mclass/device collection.
--
-- NOTE:  This primary exists to build credentials files on a host.
-- Ideally it would be generic and NOT have the limits against
-- v_device_col_acct_col_expanded but that is necesary (for now) because
-- of dependent views 
--
-- Alternately a materized view could work, but that was still pretty
-- sluggish.  A materilized view of the restricted v_device_col_account_cart
-- here speeds things up but not enough to be worth the overhead
--
