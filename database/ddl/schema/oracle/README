Here's a description of what things are.  These are auto-generated  from
modeling software for now, though we expect this to change.

This was originally designed in Oracle, and the modeling software
is still authoritative.  It should load in Oracle (and presumably
EnterpriseDB).  However, ongoing work is done in Postgresql, and
while we have made effort to not do things that will prevent oracle
from working, there are some features that have not been ported to
oracle.  We are considering abandoning oracle support completely.

At this time, the only database that works is Oracle (and probably
EnterpriseDB), and we hope to have postgresql in place in short order.

In some cases, the scripts are redundant do each other, so you don't want to
run all of them.  They're split up to make it easier to port to other
databasees, but also make it easier to build the reference platform.

We have historically kept the tables and indexes in a modeling tool in order
to do E-R diagrams and views, audit tables, and other bits are maintained out
of the schema, so there's this weird hybrid between the two.

build_audit_tables.sql
build_audit_triggers.sql
	- These are used to build the audit tables and triggers based on
	  what's in the schema.  These are not generated.

create_full_schema.sql
create_full_triggers.sql
	- These drop and recreate everything non-audit including physical
	  characteristics.

drop_triggers.sql
drop_schema.sql
	- These drop the schema and triggers, run the second, then the first
		to empty everything non-audit.
	  
create_schema_physical.sql
	- These creates the schema (tables, constraints, views) and all the
	  physical characteristics.  They make assumptions about the underlying
	  tapespace setup.

create_schema.sql
create_triggers.sql
	- Creates the schema (tables, constraints, viefws) and the triggers.
	  The triggers need to be created after views and other bits are
	  created (see ../../README), which is why they are pulled out

create_database_JAZZHANDS.sql
create_tablespace_data_blob.sql
create_schema_jazzhands_stats.sql
	- random bits that we use to set things up.  Note that this was just
		originally done against 10.2.0.something, but it runs on 11g
		as well.

create_extra_objects.sql
create_audit_indexes.sql
create_audit_views.sql
	- These create objects that aren't in the other scripts for some
	  reason.  See ../../README
