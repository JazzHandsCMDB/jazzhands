This works udner oracle and postgresql >= 9.6  Most development is now against
postgresql 12 (or greater).

The database must support hierarhical (recursive) queries in views and
natively for raw sql queries, we rely heavily on those.  This rules
mysql out at last investigation.  (These camme into existnace in 9.4).

The TL;DR way to create this from a fresh install of postgresql is:

	psql -U postgres -c 'create role schema_owners';
	psql -U postgres -c 'create user jazzhands IN ROLE schema_owners'
	psql -U postgres -c 'create database jazzhands'
	psql -U postgres -d test -f create_pgsql_from_scratch.sql

To also run all the unit tests, do this instead:

	psql -U postgres -c 'create role schema_owners';
	psql -U postgres -c 'create user jazzhands IN ROLE schema_owners'
	psql -U postgres -c 'create database jazzhands'
	psql -U postgres -d test -f create_and_test_pgsql.sql

In both cases, the jazzhands database will be dropped and recreated (without
cascade) after connecting to the template1 database and connecting back
and forth between postgres and jazzhands as needed.  This is to allow
the whole thing to be created in any database and is used in making test
images.  The script will just abort if those databases start with template,
public or postgres.  Likely that was a mistake, and if it wasn't, then
you understand enough of what you're diong to not use the TL;DR method.

For Oracle:

Oracle probably does not work anymore.

Under oracle, everthing must me loaded into the same schema.  The schema
owner is generally not used for anything else.

In the oracle variant, ip addresses are stored as numbers (in pgsql, they'll
be native), and that necessitates converting them to/from text.  This is
done through an oracle package that is a wrapper around  java bits.  The
network strings module is just used for sorting queries so cisco
interfaces Gi1/0 will be sorted by slot/port rather than by name.
Sometimes this doesn't work as well as it should.

see ddl/schema/create_database_JAZZHANDS.sql for an example of how to
create everything from a virgin install.  It assumes some things about
how the local system is laid out, and is setup for oracle 10.2.0

To load java bits, you need a java compiler and build the class files
under java/*manip.   (Makefile is there; you may need to adjust your path to
javac).  To put them in oracle, as the user that owns the schema:

loadjava -user user@DB -oci8 -resolve IPv4Manip.class
loadjava -user user@DB -oci8 -resolve NetworkStrings.class

create_oracle_schema.sql can be run from this directory to build out a
complete oracle schema without and data.

For PostgreSQL:

Much of this needs to be written.

Everything is in one database, but there are many schemas.  The main schema
is jazzhands.  [ flesh out flesh out ]

To initialize the database:

	createdb jazzhands
	psql -d jazzhands -f create_pgsql_schema.sql

custom variable classes are used throughout for auditing.

Initializing Data:

initialize_schema_data.sql will deposit a bunch of example data. Some of
it you probably want to preserve, as many of the tools expect it to be there.
Some of it, not so much.  (the optional and example files fall into this
category).

you need to create these as a superuser:
	create role picture_image_ro;
	create role picture_image_rw;
	create role picture_image_rm;
