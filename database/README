At present, this is only supported under oracle (and probably enterprsiedb).
We hope to add postgresql support (>= 8.4) in the near future. 

The database must support hierarhical (recursive) queries in views and
natively for raw sql queries, we rely heavily on those.  This rules
mysql out at last investigation.

In the oracle variant, ip addresses are stored as numbers (in pgsql, they'll
be native), and that necessitates converting them to/from text.  This is
done through an oracle package that is a wrapper around  java bits.  The
network strings module is just used for sorting queries so cisco
interfaces Gi1/0 will be sorted by slot/port rather than by name.
Sometimes this doesn't work as well as it should.

To load java bits, you need a java compiler and build the class files
under java/*manip.   (Makefile is there; you may need to adjust your path to
javac).  To put them in oracle:

loadjava -user system@DB -oci8 -resolve IPv4Manip.class
loadjava -user system@DB -oci8 -resolve NetworkStrings.class

create_oracle_schema.sql can be run from this directory to build out a
complete oracle schema without and data.
