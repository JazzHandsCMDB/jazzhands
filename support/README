THIS IS NOT READY FOR REAL RELEASE YET...

This is the first pass at generating a release.  It does not handle the
database (important!), debs and pulls versions from the spec files intead of
tags, but its a step in the right direction

NOTES:

- release contains information on what to release
- build-release spits out .tar.gzs in the current directory that are release
  ready (well, for some definition).  More work needs to be done.
- The dockerfiles build rpms and debs appropriately and make sure they
  build, then put the output in ./deb or ./rpm
