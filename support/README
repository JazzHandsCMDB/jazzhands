THIS IS NOT READY FOR REAL RELEASE YET...

This is the first pass at generating a release.  It does not handle the
database (important!), debs and pulls versions from the spec files intead of
tags, but its a step in the right direction

NOTES:

- release contains information on releases
- build-release spits out .tar.gzs in the current directory that are release
  ready (well, for some definition).  More work needs to be done.

testing was done with:

rm -f *.tgz
./build-release
fail=''
for i in *.gz ; do rpmbuild -tb $i || fail="$file $i"; done
echo $fail
