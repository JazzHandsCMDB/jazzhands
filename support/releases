# config file for generating release.   This is fed into build-releases.
# The eventual goal is to pass a command line # argument to this script, 
# have it match a tag and it will go and generate tarballs for release.
#
# For now, it just pulls version information out of the debian/changelog
# file in each directory.  A .spec file is generated based on those files plus
# a ocnverted version of the changelog
#
# to add things, crib a  debian directory from somewhere, and a spec file and
# make it work.
#
# from inside the source tree, 'dpkg-buildpackage -tc' will build a deb from
# scratch
#
# to build rpms, run ./build-release and them rpmbuild -ta whatever.tar.gz
